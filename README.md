# Js-Colour-Palette-Creator
This is my third Javascript project, and like the first and second it is following a Javascript course on https://developedbyed.com/, however unlike the first I have deviated more from the course and I am deffinately far more confident with Javascript now. This was also my introduction to Js libraries withs chroma-js, which was fun to play around with.

This project is a web app which allows users to create and save their own colour palettes, I am very happy with the final code, one way I may do is make the whole project object oriented, however I think I will save this for my own original projects rather than one from a tutorial. One part I am very proud of is the colour adjustment sliders as well as how polished the whole app feels.
